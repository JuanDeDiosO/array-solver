# Matrix Console Interface
Matrix Console Interface is a command-line tool that provides functionalities for matrix operations. It allows users to perform tasks like matrix multiplication, addition, and extension conveniently via a console interface.

## Description
This project provides a console interface for performing matrix operations. The functionality code (`Matrix`) implements operations like multiplication and addition, while the interface code (`Flow`) uses Inquirer to prompt users for input. It's designed for individuals needing to manipulate matrices conveniently via the command line, streamlining tasks in fields like mathematics, statistics, or engineering.
